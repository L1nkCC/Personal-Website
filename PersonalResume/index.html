            Passion For Software
        </h4>
        <div>
            Connor has been experimenting with code and computers since he was a child with youth bootcamps on Java and OO principals. 
            As he grew, so did his interest towards technology.
            He pursued this passion further and further as he progressed through high-school and as he got to college at Univeristy of Kentucky, he decided to study Computer Science. 
            Whilst studying at the Univeristy of Kentucky, he tackled technical classes with ease including:
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>Discrete Mathematics,</li>
            <li>Database Systems,</li>
            <li>Artifical Intelligence,</li>
            <li>and Machine Learning.</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
            In May of 2023, Connor completed his Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with a 3.87 GPA and Mathematics minor. 
            Since then, he has been taking some time off to travel and work on small projects in order to learn more about other technologies.

        College Involvement

        <div>
            Connor's college years were full of extra-curricular activities, new expreiences, and a drive to support his community.
            He began with joining Univeristy of Kentucky's 
            <a href="https://www.uky.edu/honors/home">Lewis Honors College</a>
            and through this registered with the even more selective 
            <a href="https://www.engr.uky.edu/students/undergraduate/academic-enhancements/seam-honors-engrmgt">Scholars in Engineering and Management (SEAM)</a>
            pathway.
            This program's missision is to integrate lessons from technical cirricula with those of business to synthesized understanding of their connection and reliance on one another.
            These interdisciplinary studies provided Connor with the fundamentals in buisness, marketing, and project management especially in their relation to the technology industry.
            For his graduation from this program, Connor along with a team of 4 others wrote a 30 page research paper regarding the project management of two different missile defense projects,
            the Patriot missile defense system and the Soviet Air Defense Forces's nuclear early warning system.
            <br/>
            He went on to develop a hobby in his Univeristy's Rock Climbing Club of which he became the vice-president in his junior year and president in his senior. 
            This offered a good way to allievate some stress and provide a healthy outlet for physical exercise and social interaction.
            His managerial responsibilites in the organization reinforced lessons from SEAM and developed Connor's dependability as a leader.
            <br/>
            His drive to help his community was spotlighted when he joined up with <a href="https://www.uky.edu/wildcatsatthecapitol/home">WilDCats at the Capitol</a>. 
            This program helps place students into internships in Washington, D.C. and placing them among others in the program in communal living. 
            While living in D.C., Connor worked directly with the United States House of Representatives in a Representative's office. 
            This was an invaluble experience coaching him in the requirements of professional work and decorum but most importantly how to fend off adversity from others with composure and patience.

            Connor took a break following his graduation on the consideration of multiple weddings that would have impacted an early career signfigantly.
            This freedom from a full schedule left him with many opprotunities; He did not squander a single one.
            He went travelling, taking a vacation to Canada and to Japan, experiencing a foreign view on his own culture and experiencing others' customs directly.
            Even this didn't fill his time completely, so he started experimenting with aspects of technology he had not experienced like web development or editor scripting in the Unity development platform.
            Now, he continues to tinker with unfamiliar toys and excited to truely get started on his career.
