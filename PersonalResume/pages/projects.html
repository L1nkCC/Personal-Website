            Connor, after developing the alpha iteration of Yugioh Progressive was dissatisfied at the organizational processes that were used and were available by Unity.
            Through this issue, he grew interest in Unity's Editor scripting and developing tools for Unity game development. 
            First, he made a small project, the 
            <a href="https://github.com/L1nkCC/Unity-Enum-Creator-Editor-Window">Enum Creator Editor Window </a>
            .
            This was an introduction to the editor scripting environment for Connor.
            It was short however, extremely important so that Connor could have a basis in this skill.
            Now, he works on a larger project, a 
            <a href= "https://github.com/L1nkCC/Unity-Sound-System">Sound System manager</a>
            that will help the game development process by organizing sounds into types and allowing for automatic creation of a Sound volume menu.
